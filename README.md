## **Overview**  
Topic Search is a simple and responsive topic filtering application built with Next.js. It mimics the TOTLE Catalogue Management System’s topic browsing functionality. Users can search from a predefined list of topics and get instant, real-time results as they type — clean, quick, and user-friendly.

## **Features** 🚀  
✅ **Real-Time Filtering** – Instantly filters topics by name (case-insensitive).  

✅ **Search Input** – A modern input with live response for better user experience.  

✅ **Topic Cards** – Each topic displays both name and category.  

✅ **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

✅ **Error Handling** – Gracefully handles no matches with a helpful message. 

✅ **Simple UI** – Clean grey theme with minimalistic structure for clarity.
